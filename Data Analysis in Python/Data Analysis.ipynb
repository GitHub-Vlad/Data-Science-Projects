    "The data set I chose was an HR data set used in the HR Metrics and Analytics department at the New England College of Business. This data set was created to allow HR professionals to learn data analysis. One reason I chose this set is because I believe the data is good for creating visualizations and allowing me to learn data visualization. I retrieved this data set from kaggle.

We also see from \"Needs Improvement\" to \"Fully Meets\" on several occasions, such as from about 70,000 where Employee: \"Needs Improvement\" and has a lower employee satisfaction(2.0) to a salary of over 100,000 and employee satisfaction of 3.0.

This by default would mean that creating plots in matplotlib would require more lines of code than in seaborn. Looking at the graphs in both this certainly holds true. A simple one-liner using seaborn can  take various lines in matplotlib. I would also like to note that the two can be integrated. We use the .plot() function from matplotlib even when using the seaborn library."
